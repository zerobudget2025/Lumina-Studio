## 🚀 Why Lumina-Studio?

Born from a late-night session when traditional AI image limits hit their peak—now anyone can generate perfect social media visuals without a design degree. 

Lumina-Studio was built to solve the "blank canvas" problem. By combining **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image**'s speed with **Gemini 3 Pro**'s high-resolution reasoning, we've created a tool that understands the *context* of where your image is going. It's not just a prompt; it's a platform-optimized creative partner.
